## About

This game was developed as part of a course during my bachelor's (the course was called 'Game Development 1'). **The game was made with Unity and coded in C# (.NET).**

This game is a single-player played on PC using a mouse and keyboard. The player's goal is to solve the mystery and figure out why the company is corrupt. The player reaches their goal by defeating enemies through 'debate-battles'. The player can walk around and explore the world and find various items that can help them with their battles.

## My contribution

I programmed and coded a lot of miscellaneous things such as the health bar, the combat UI, a game save function, made sure the sound and music ran correctly, highlights on interactable objects, etc.
